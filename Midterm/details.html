        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>My Name is Guadalupe Ramirez. This fall 2020 is my fourth semester in BMCC. My major is Multimedia Programming and Design. I don't have a specific career yet, but I'm intrested in web designing or something that has to do with codes like html. I am twenty-two years old and some of my hobbies are drawing and doing graffiti. I don't know the name of every sneaker or it's history, but I could name a few when I see them. Buying sneakers was one of my favorite passions before COVID 19 started. I was working for Sarabeth's Bakery in lower Manhattan, but I'm unemployed for now.</p>
